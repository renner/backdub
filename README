Backdub is a generic backup solution that can be used for archiving any kind of files and directories.

This is how to get started:

- Create a configuration file (see 'config.template')
- Create a target file containing filesystem paths (see 'target.example')
- Perform a backup of a target file by calling './backdub.py <targetfile>'
